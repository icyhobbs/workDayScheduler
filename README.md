## User Story

With the virus still running rampant and practically unchecked in american offices, forward thinking employers are affording their
minions the opportunity to work remotely. In order to facilitate the mantra "business as usual", a calendar page needs to be available
to be able to lay out the days schedule so that time can be effectively managed in succinct and orderly fashion. I have created a simple
calendar page that allows an end user to save events for each hour of the day. This page will run in the browser and feature dynamically
updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
